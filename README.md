What is the project? Cryptocurrency Trading Bot with a GUI
What is the MVP (Minimal Viable Product)? I have opted to create a crypto trading bot with an interface. I will use this display interface to follow trades and market data by using Binanace API & the BitcoinCharts API to pull in financial data & trades about cryptocurrencies.
What are the sprinkles? The look & feel of the interface
When will the project be complete? July 29th at 12:00 (noon), sharp!
